## Description 
Cyber Coalition exercise was a five-day exercise conducted in Tartu, Estonia, from 2 to 6 December, 2019. It is organized by Allied Command Transformation (ACT) and conducted annually. In its 12th iteration, the Cyber Coalition exercise focused on developing new tactics, techniques, and procedures with NATO's Cyberspace Operations Centre (CyOC). Over 900 players from 28 NATO Allies and partner nations gathered to participate in scenarios released from the Cyber Range platform. The participants needed to detect attacks and provide feedback on the observed state and the malicious code's impact on other participants. This allowed the participants, mainly members of armed forces, to further develop response capabilities to a series of cyber threats.
