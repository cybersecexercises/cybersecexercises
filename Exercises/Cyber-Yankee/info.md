## Description 
Cyber Yankee was a cybersecurity exercise entirely hosted on a ShadowNet enterprise solution, a platform that uses VPN connectivity to provide cyber training at the individual and collective levels. Using the realistic cyber environment, participants could train to react and defend critical infrastructure against cyber-attacks. The event's primary audience was the "Blue" teams, comprised of National Guard cyber elements that assisted in the cyber defense of civilian industry partners. Furthermore, the "White" team assessed the "Blue" teams' responses to the simulated attacks and could adjust the exercise pace. Participants included Defensive Cyberspace Operations Elements (DCOE) Teams and Cyber Defenders from the six New England states, Alabama and New York, USA. The exercise was conducted from 5 to 9 August 2019 and hosted by the Virginia Army National Guard. Cyber Yankee served as a lead-up event for the 2020 National Level Exercise.
