## Description 
Cyber Flag was a weeklong tactical cybersecurity exercise conducted at the Joint Staffâ€™s facility in Suffolk, Virginia, from 21st to 28th June 2019. The U.S. Cyber Command organized the exercise. In its ninth iteration, the exercise gathered more than 650 participants, who were members of the Defense Department and other federal agencies and partner nations. The participants worked in 20 teams that attempted to combat malicious attacks and intrusions on an Industrial Control Systems/Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition network built specifically for this exercise. The network simulated a network that might be used by a U.S.-based port facility. This exercise aimed to increase the readiness of the cyber mission force, deepen partnerships, and increase cooperation and coordination internally and between allies involved in the exercise.
