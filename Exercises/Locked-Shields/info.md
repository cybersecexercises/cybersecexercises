## Description 
Locked Shields exercise is organized by the NATO CCDCOE. It has been conducted annually since 2010 and serves as a way for cybersecurity experts to enhance their skills in defending the critical infrastructure, as well as national IT systems, under real-time attacks. Locked Shields is organized as a Red vs. Blue Team exercise, where the Blue Team is comprised of member nations of CCDCOE. More than 1200 experts from nearly 30 nations participated in the Locked Shields exercise held from 8th to 12th of April 2019. While simultaneously maintaining around 4000 virtualized systems and experiencing around 2500 attacks, the teams needed to report incidents, execute strategic decisions, and solve forensic, legal, and media challenges. In 2019, the Locked Shields exercise concentrated on improving communication between experts and decision-makers. This goal was accomplished by integrating a technical and strategic game, which meant that the participating nations could practice the entire chain of command in the event of a severe cyber incident that could compromise vital services and critical infrastructure. The scenario involved a series of cyberattacks against a leading civilian internet service provider and maritime surveillance system in a fictional country. The attacks caused severe disruptions in the power generation and distribution, 4G communication systems, maritime surveillance, and water purification plant. The technical game aimed to maintain the critical infrastructure operation, while the strategic part of the exercise was to make the crucial decisions and understand their impact at the strategic and policy level.
