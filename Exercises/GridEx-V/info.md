## Description 
The most notable and well-documented exercise held in 2019 is the GridEx V exercise. GridEx is organized by The North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) and conducted every two years, this being its fifth installment. Conducted in November 2019, the exercise aims to provide an opportunity for utilities to demonstrate their response and recovery from cyber- and physical security threats and incidents. Primarily concentrated on the Electricity sector, GridEx V was the largest geographically distributed grid security exercise to date. Participants joined in from North America, Mexico, UK, New Zealand, and Australia. The exercise was structured as two days of distributed play and one day of the executive tabletop. The Canadian Electricity Association (CEA) conducted a separate executive tabletop on the same day, but with a different scenario. NERC published an extensive after-action report describing the event and lessons learned in March 2020 (NERC, 2020).
