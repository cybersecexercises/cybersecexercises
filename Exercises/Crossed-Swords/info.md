## Description 
Crossed Swords is an annual red teaming exercise organized jointly by the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCDCOE) and CERT.LV. More than 100 experts from 23 countries participated in this technical cyber exercise, aiming to train penetration testers, digital forensics experts, and situational awareness experts. Aside from the cyber-kinetic operations, this exercise also involves leadership training for the command element and legal aspects. Exercise challenges included industrial control systems, physical security systems, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV), unmanned ground vehicles (UGV), and maritime surveillance systems. Like in the Locked Shields exercise, Threod provided its software and hardware for the exercise execution. Aside from the Threod simulators, KX4 LE Titan was also used in this exercise. The 2019 exercise took place from 21 to 23 January in Tallinn, Estonia, while members of the Estonian Defence Forces provided the command component. For many participants, Crossed Swords serves as a preparation for Locked Shields, which share the same organizers.
