## Description 
In 2019, The Cyber Security Research, Development and Training Centre, JYVSECTEC, (Jyv채skyl채 Security Technology), together with the Secretariat of The Security Committee of the state of Finland, organized a National Cyber Security Exercise. The exercise was conducted from 20th to 24th May at the IT institute of JAMK University of Applied Sciences in Jyv채skyl채. It is a continuation of the cybersecurity exercises which commenced in 2013. Participants were members of the public sector, such as the Finnish Government ICT Centre and The Social Insurance Institution of Finland. The Realistic Global Cyber Environment (RGCE) was used in the exercise, a tool that enables the participants to further their cybersecurity skills by threat modeling. Thus, during the exercise, the participants could manage and control simulated incidents and examine and recover from various threats.
