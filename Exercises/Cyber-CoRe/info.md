## Description 
Cyber Cooperative Resilience, or Cyber CoRe, is a cybersecurity exercise organized for the private sector by Ernst & Young and CybExer Technologies, an Estonian IT company. From 25th to 27th November 2019 was the second time this exercise was held in the Tallinn office of CybExer. The exercise gathered participants into blue teams that defended IT infrastructure against red team cyber attacks. Blue teams represented a single organization or comprised of members of different companies and agencies. It was formed as a competition between blue teams that practiced their cyber defense skills through identification, protection, detection, response, recovering, and reporting. The exercise was hosted at the CybExer Cyber Range Platform, which simulated the attacks. CybExer's Integrated Scoring and Awareness (ISA) solution was also used in the exercise and provided the staff with instant visualization of the exercise data. This exercise's target audience was a technical staff involved in technical IT-security or cyber defense.
