## Description 
Mile High Dice is an annual exercise organized by the Colorado Federal Executive Board (CFEB) and the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) Region VIII. On November 14th, 2019, the exercise took place at the Federal Bureau of Prisons National Corrections Academy, Aurora, Colorado, US. It was a tabletop exercise whose participants were members of both the public and private sectors. Agencies and organizations were encouraged to build teams consisting of several different roles, such as executive leaders, public information officers, information technology, financial resources, human resources, etc. The topic of the 2019 exercise was “Security Awareness of Soft Targets and Crowded Places Workshop,” which included two training sessions, “Case Study: Las Vegas Shooting” and “Security Engineering,” which lasted 8 hours. The exercise aims to allow participants to improve their continuity plans and procedures by learning the latest policy updates, discussing their planning efforts, testing their planning assumptions, and sharing best practices.
