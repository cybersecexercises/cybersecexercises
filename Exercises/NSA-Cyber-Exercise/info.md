## Description 

NSA Cyber Exercise (NSX) is a three-day exercise that challenges cadets and midshipmen of the US Service Academies in adverse cyber operations. In 2019, participants were challenged to improve their strategic cybersecurity skills and teamwork, planning, communication, and decision-making. The exercise is organized by the National Security Agency (NSA) and took place from 15th to 17th April 2019, at the US Air Force Academy in Colorado Springs, Colorado. It was divided into four five-hour long modules, including forensics, data analysis, cyber policy, software development, an eight-hour cyber combat exercise, and a few cyber team-building activities. At the end of the exercise, a winner was declared.
