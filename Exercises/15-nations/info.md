## Description 
In November 2019, Taiwan hosted a five-day international cybersecurity exercise co-hosted by the United States and Taiwan. It involved 15 nations from America, Asia, and Europe. It was divided into two parts: the first part being the test of government and staff officials' response to phishing emails or text messages, and the second part was constructed as an examination of the response of members of private and public sectors to cyber-attacks. The simulated attacks were designed to illustrate malicious attempts to infiltrate confidential data belonging to the Taiwanese government or financial institutions and test the local security team's capability to defend against these attacks. Participants were thus sectioned into red and blue teams, with Taiwan's security team constituting the blue team and 15 other nations constituting the red team. After the training and exercise, the discussion on lessons learned followed.
