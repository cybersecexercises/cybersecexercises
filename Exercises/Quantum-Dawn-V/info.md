## Description 
Quantum Dawn is a series of cybersecurity exercises that enable vital public and private bodies worldwide to practice their response and coordination when faced with a series of sector-wide global cyberattacks. It is organized by SIFMA, a trade association for broker-dealers, investment banks, and asset managers operating in the U.S. and global capital markets and therefore focused mainly on the financial sector. The exercise is held every two years, this being its fifth installment. On 7 November, 2019, the exercise took place and included over 600 participants from more than 180 financial institutions and government agencies worldwide. The scenario included a simulation of a ransomware attack orchestrated by a criminal insider that targeted globally critical financial institutions. After the exercises, SIFMA released an after-action report (SIFMA, 2020), which included exercise summary and conclusions.
