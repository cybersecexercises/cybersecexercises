## Description 
Organized by the Supreme Allied Command Europe and NATO CIS Group (NCISG) and executed from May to June 2019, Steadfast Cobalt is an annual cybersecurity exercise whose primary purpose is to test communication and information systems for the NATO Response Force. Soldiers from 35 NATO Communications and Information Security Structures participated in the exercise with the primary goal of creating a mission-ready network for the NATO Response Force. The exercise was performed from multiple locations across Europe, while the central location was in Bucharest, Romania. While the exercise's exact details remain unknown, the resulting mission network has been tested and evaluated. Furthermore, this network allows the commander of the NATO Response Force rotation to command and control his forces in upcoming exercises and events in which the force must be activated.
